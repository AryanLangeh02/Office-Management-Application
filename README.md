# OfficeManagementApp
An executable JAR file has been created, through which the users can access the application. The file is titled "IAFinal.jar" and is located in the "dist" folder. Java and PostgreSQL must be installed in order to view the application. Users must know their PostgreSQL username and password in order to make full use of the application. 

The database must first be setup. The user can do so from the Login Page. Failure to setup the database will prevent users from logging into the application and making full use of it.
